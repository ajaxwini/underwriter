I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.'"
